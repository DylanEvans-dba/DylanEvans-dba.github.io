## First Enhancement and Narrative
  RETURN
	The first artifact that I have decided to examine is a restfull API written in  RETURN
Python that I developed for a stock ticker application that I was assigned to  RETURN
produce for CS-340 a few terms back, so late 2020. It functioned as an intermediary  RETURN
between the front-end stock ticker application and the back-end MongoDB database that  RETURN
stored the stock information as JSON data.  RETURN
	  RETURN 
	I chose this artifact because it encompasses several facets of software design in   RETURN
my mind. It is a Python-based API that was written for a web-based application with a   RETURN
MongoDB database on the backend that stores data in JSON format and whose native query   RETURN
language was JavaScript. This API effectively represents the centerpiece of a collection   RETURN
of other files, functions, applications, and more that served as the various, unrelated   RETURN
portions of this stock ticker app. All held together solely by the glue of the API that   RETURN
connected them.   RETURN
   RETURN
	Moving on from poetic waxing, a lot of testing went into the design of this API   RETURN
at the time that I was designing the project, but in all honesty so much time has passed   RETURN
that I’m afraid any serious “enhancements” I would make to the code would only result in   RETURN
less-than-desirable outcomes. As such, I have opted to improve the artifact by improving   RETURN
readability. While the code is (debatably) about as cleanly formatted and readable as it   RETURN
could be, I felt the comments could use some cleaning up and clarifying. I have unified the   RETURN
formatting of existing comments by enforcing grammatical standards throughout. I have also   RETURN
clarified the language of existing comments as well as added new comments to hopefully help   RETURN
fill in some potential lapses in clarity in the code that was not already explained by other   RETURN
comments.   RETURN
  RETURN
	I feel that I have sufficiently met the course requirements with this enhancement.   RETURN
Yes, there is the strong potential that I could have made a more impactful enhancement to   RETURN
the artifact. Perhaps improved its efficiency or further modularized the code. However, I   RETURN
again felt that it was in the best interest of the code as a cohesive, and functional, artifact   RETURN
that I limited my rusted expertise to more minor improvements. With all of that said, I do feel   RETURN
that readability is extremely important in software design in every instance except job security   RETURN
when you are the one person that currently has the job. Even in that instance, future you will   RETURN
be thankful for the time taken to make their life easier.   RETURN
  RETURN
	While enhancing this artifact have less learned than reinforced my stance on readability   RETURN
of code. Looking over my comments from the pre-enhanced artifact where its mix of punctuation   RETURN
standards as well as grammatical spacing and capitalization made it difficult to differentiate   RETURN
code from comment in some instances. I hope that my added enhancements has remedied this issue   RETURN
and made future me, as well as anyone else reading this code, a bit more at ease.   RETURN
